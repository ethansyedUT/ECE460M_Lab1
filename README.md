# About-the-project
This is the first real lab of 460M
I created a 1-bit subtract module with logic eq (rather than - operator)
I then created a 4-bit subtractor module using a combination of 4 1-bit modules

# Testing 
I created a testbench for the 4-bit subtractor where I provided a stimulus of the following
A = 1001, B = 0011, Bin = 1
A = 0011, B = 0110, Bin = 1

After simulating in Vivado and watching the output of the signals the module seems to be working properly

# Status 
Finished
